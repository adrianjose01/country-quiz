## 📝 About

The Country Quiz is a simple quiz game where users are presented with questions about countries.  
Each round contains a multiple-choice question, and the player must choose the correct answer from four options.

Questions can be based on:

- 🏳 **Flags** → “Which country does this flag belong to?”
- 🏙 **Capitals** → “(Capital) is the capital of…”

Once the user selects an answer:

- The correct answer is highlighted.
- The user receives immediate feedback.
- The game continues until all questions are answered.

At the end of the quiz, the app displays the **final score** and offers the option to **play again**.
